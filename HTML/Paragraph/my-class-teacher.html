                    Teachers are friendly guides who help us learn and grow.

                    Always patient and caring, they answer questions, share stories, and cheer us on.
                    Teachers make school a special place where we can explore, discover, and succeed.

            Hello guys I am a solo devoloper, and for my projects I need to research.
            So, I have to go in many sites to find what I need to know.
            And when I was still reading in school I had to buy many books for english.
            So, I thought lets build a one stop website for students.
            Remember <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/index.html">schoolGArbage.com</a> is not the only website for this purpose.
            My inspiration to build this website is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.myallgarbage.com">myAllGarbage.com</a> website.
