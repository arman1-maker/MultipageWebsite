                    A hobby is something fun we do in our free time, like gardening.
                    I’ve been gardening for two years and love watching my plants grow.
                    I have flowers and vegetables in my garden.
                    Gardening makes me happy and helps me relax.
                    Sharing what I grow with others makes me proud.

                Because when you do that it will become easier.
                Like all those games and TV shows that you have no problem remembering the story.

                    Hobby refers to an activity someone does for pleasure in their free time.
                    It is something that one enjoys doing and often becomes a regular part of their routine.
                    There can be a wide variety of hobbies, depending on people's interests.
                    Such as painting, playing musical instruments, gardening, cooking, hiking, or collecting items like stamps and coins.
                    I am a student, and my hobby is gardening.
                    Because every day when I see my plants growing bigger than the previous day, it lights up my face with happiness.
                    I have been gardening for two years. Now I have a big garden with various types of plants and flowers.
                    I have Nayantara, Oporajita, Gadha, Rajanigandha, and Rose. I also grow seasonal fruits and vegetables.
                    Every day when I am tired, gardening makes my tiredness go away.
                    It refreshes my mood, and with regular work, my body stays active and fit.
                    When my plants grow and the first harvest comes, it is the best time to see the plants grow this much.
                    After harvest, I share it with people, and when they express their minds, it fills me with pride.
                    So, I enjoy every bit of gardening.

            Hello guys I am a solo devoloper, and for my projects I need to research.
            So, I have to go in many sites to find what I need to know.
            And when I was still reading in school I had to buy many books for english.
            So, I thought lets build a one stop website for students.
            Remember <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="/index.html">schoolGArbage.com</a> is not the only website for this purpose.
            My inspiration to build this website is <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.myallgarbage.com">myAllGarbage.com</a> website.
